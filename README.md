TODO:
1. Every Angular component must be in a separate script file.


4. The controller must add an array of sample todo objects to the view model. Each todo object has “task” (string) and “completed” (boolean). Include a mix of complete and incomplete items.
5. The ​ngRepeat​ directive must be used.
6. The ​ngClass​ directive must be used to add a “completed” class for completed todos.
7. The ​ngIf​ directive must be used to remove the button “complete” button for completed todos.
8. “x” buttons, “complete” buttons, the two inputs, and the “Add” button are all non-functional for now. Just add them to the HTML and style them. We will make them work in the next lab.
